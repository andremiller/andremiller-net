Pinouts for the Raspberry Pi P1 header, showing pins that can be used
for general purpose IO. I used some online sources to get the naming for
the pins (source list at the bottom of this post). Some of the power and
ground pins were initially marked as ‘do not connect’, but it has now
been confirmed that these pins won’t change so I included them below as
well (Pins 4, 9, 14, 17, 20 and 25).

A few pins changed between Revision 1 and Revision 2 of the board (Pins
3, 5 and 13). The pin description in the table below shows first the
Revision 1 GPIO number followed by a slash and then the Revision 2 GPIO
number.
